Crowsourced Knowledge Acquisition

This repository provides resources that result from an approach of building ontology concepts from knowledge acquired from crowdsourcing
that is published and presented at the Cognition and OntologieS (CAOS) workshop 2017 collocated with The AISB Convention. The two 
crowdsourcing methods used are a mechanized labor-based approach using CrowdFlower and a game-based approach using a game app that adapated
the popular guessing game Taboo. Currently, the repository only provides the ontology used to evaluate the concept formation, which we 
did by developing ontologies related to city instances based on the Table of Contents (TOCs) of Wikipedia pages of those city instances and 
the source code. The data from the crowdsourcing processes are currently being used in a computational challenge and can only be included
published once the challenge has taken place in the summer of 2017.
